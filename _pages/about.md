Welcome
======

Welcome to the website for Dr. Bradley N. Jack's cognitive neuroscience laboratory in the Research School of Psychology at the Australian National University.

Research
======

Our research is in the field of cognitive neuroscience. Here is a list of current projects:

* <b>Action, perception, and cognition.</b> Action, perception, and cognition are often studied separately, but our actions produce sensory input (e.g., knocking on a door causes a sound), and what we think influences what we perceive (e.g., a picture of a grey-scale banana is seen as yellow). The goal of this research is to understand how the functions of action, perception, and cognition interact to help us make sense of the world.

* <b>Inner speech.</b> Inner speech – the silent production of words in one’s mind – is one of the most pervasive and ubiquitous activities that humans engage in, yet relatively little is known about it. The goal of this research is to understand the neural processes involved in inner speech and to build a BCI capable of decoding inner speech in real-time.

* <b>EEG/ERP methodologies and analyses.</b> We are passionate about EEG/ERP methodologies and analyses, including experimental design, data collection, data pre-processing, data analysis, and the assessment and quantification of statistical evidence. The goal of this research is to develop good scientific practice for the EEG/ERP technique.
